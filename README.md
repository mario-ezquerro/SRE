SRE for the rest of humans [Logs, opentelemetry, docker, proxy, etc]

Site reliability engineering (SRE) is an approach that applies software engineering principles to infrastructure and operations. Its core objective is to build and maintain highly scalable and reliable software systems. SRE is often viewed as a specific implementation of DevOps, a methodology that integrates software development and IT operations. Essentially, SRE is the "how-to" for putting DevOps' collaborative ideals into practice.
